Mushroom Classification using Feature Selection and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of two feature selection methods
— correlation-based and Sequential Forward Selection (SFS)
— to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using several machine learning models.
It evaluates and compares the predictive power of both feature sets across multiple classifiers using the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) metric.

The dataset used is the Mushroom Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains 8124 mushroom records with 22 categorical features and a target label (class: edible = e, poisonous = p).
