Neural Network Modeling on Car Evaluation and Auto MPG Datasets

This project applies neural networks (MLPs) to solve two tasks:
Classification using the Car Evaluation dataset
Regression using the Auto MPG dataset
Both models are trained and evaluated with different configurations, and their performance is analyzed.

The dataset used is the Auto-Mpg Data Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
